# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding install the following requirements.
- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.21.6)

## Getting CoCos
Get the cocos repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos.git`

### HAL
Get the hardware abstraction layer from the [releases](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos/releases) on the cocos repository. Two files will be required:
- `rootfs.cpio.gz` - Initramfs
- `bzImage` - Kernel

Create two directories in `cocos/cmd/manager`, the directories are `img` and `tmp`.
Copy the downloaded files to `cocos/cmd/manager/img`. If using the latest version of cocos see the Developer guide for instructions on building HAL.

## Starting Manager Server
Manager is a gRPC client and needs gRPC sever to connect to. We have an example server for testing purposes in `test/manager-server`. Run the server as follows:

```shell
go run ./test/computations/main.go /path/to/algo/file /path/to/public/key/file <attested_tls_bool> /path/to/data/file1.zip path/to/data/file2.zip path/to/data/file3.zip
```

Multiple data files can be provided, depending on the nature of the algorithm and type of data.

The output should be simillar to this:
`{"time":"2024-03-19T12:27:46.542638146+03:00","level":"INFO","msg":"manager_test_server service gRPC server listening at :7001 without TLS"}`

The test server uses the paths to the algorithm and datasets to obtain the file and include the file hashes to the computation manifest. The files are uploaded to agent via cli. The public key provided can be generated using openssl or cocos-cli.

## Running Manager
Next we need to start manager. But first we'll need to install some prerequisites.

### Vsock
[Virtio-vsock](https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/VirtioVsock) is a host/guest communications device. It allows applications in the guest and host to communicate. In this case, it is used to communicate between manager and agent. To enable it run the following on the host:
`sudo modprobe vhost_vsock`

to confirm that it is enabled run:
`ls -l /dev/vsock` and `ls -l /dev/vhost-vsock`
the output should be simillar to this respectively:
`crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 10, 121 Mar 18 14:01 /dev/vsock` and `crw-rw-rw- 1 root kvm 10, 241 Mar 18 14:01 /dev/vhost-vsock`

### OVMF
Find the ovmf code file:
```shell
sudo find / -name OVMF_CODE.fd
```
The output will be simillar to this:
```shell
/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd
/usr/share/edk2/ia32/OVMF_CODE.fd
```

Find the ovmf vars file:
```shell
sudo find / -name OVMF_VARS.fd
```
the output will be simillar to this 
```shell
/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd
/usr/share/edk2/ia32/OVMF_VARS.fd
```

### Run
When manager connects to the computations server, the server then sends a computation manifest. In response manager will sends logs and events from the computation both from manager and agent. To start run:

```shell
cd cmd/manager
MANAGER_GRPC_URL=localhost:7001 \
    MANAGER_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
    MANAGER_QEMU_USE_SUDO=false \
    MANAGER_QEMU_ENABLE_SEV=false \
    MANAGER_QEMU_SEV_CBITPOS=51 \
    MANAGER_QEMU_OVMF_CODE_FILE=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \
    MANAGER_QEMU_OVMF_VARS_FILE=/usr/share/edk2/ovmf/OVMF_VARS.fd \
    ./build/cocos-manager
```

The output on manager will be simillar to this:
```shell

From the logs we see agent has been bound to port `48592` which we can use with agent cli to send the algorithm, datasets and retrieve results. In this case the `AGENT_GRPC_URL` will be `localhost:48592`. 

To test agent proceed to [CLI](/cli), where the algorithm will be uploaded, followed by the dataset, which will be followed by result retrieval once results are ready.

For real-world examples to test with cocos, see our [AI repository](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/ai).
